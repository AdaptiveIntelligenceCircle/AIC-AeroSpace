# Security Policy – AIC-Aerospace

## Security Philosophy

Security in AIC-Aerospace is not only technical —  
it is **civilizational security**.

A failure in space intelligence systems can have irreversible consequences.

## Scope

This project focuses on:
- Simulation-level safety
- Architectural safeguards
- Ethical and control-layer security

It does NOT deploy real-world aerospace hardware.

## Threat Model

Primary risks include:
- Unbounded autonomous decision-making
- Misuse of navigation or ISRU logic
- Militarized adaptation of research outputs
- Over-optimization without human oversight

## Safeguards

- Human-in-the-loop design
- Explicit ethical constraints
- Conservative adaptation rates
- Transparency in decision logic

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you identify:
- Safety-critical design flaws
- Ethical bypass risks
- Potential dual-use misuse paths

Please report privately to:
**ndtribk@gmail.com**  
(or open a confidential issue if email is unavailable)

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure.
We value prevention over blame.

## Zero Tolerance

Any attempt to weaponize this research will result in:
- Immediate revocation of access
- Public disassociation from the project
