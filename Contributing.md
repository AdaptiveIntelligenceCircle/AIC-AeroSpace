# Contributing to AIC-Aerospace

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project values **depth over speed**,  
**responsibility over scale**,  
**ethics over hype**.

## Who Should Contribute

We welcome contributors with interest in:
- Aerospace systems
- Autonomous navigation
- Systems safety
- AI ethics & governance
- Simulation and modeling
- Philosophy of technology

## Contribution Types

- Architecture proposals
- Research notes and simulations
- Ethical analysis
- Documentation improvements
- Critical reviews and risk analysis

## How to Contribute

1. Read the philosophy documents in `/docs`
2. Open an issue describing your proposal
3. Explain:
   - Purpose
   - Risks
   - Ethical considerations
4. Submit a pull request if approved conceptually

## Design Rules

- No black-box autonomy
- No irreversible decisions without oversight
- No performance-only optimization
- Every system must be explainable

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed for:
- Technical validity
- Ethical impact
- Long-term implications

Rejection is not personal.
Caution is a feature, not a bug.

## Final Note

This project is not about reaching space faster.

It is about **arriving as something worth bringing there**.
