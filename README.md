AIC-Aerospace is a non-profit, open research initiative under the Adaptive Intelligence Circle (AIC),  
focused on applying adaptive, ethical, and human-aligned intelligence systems to space exploration.

Unlike traditional aerospace programs driven by military dominance, profit, or prestige, AIC-Aerospace treats space as a **shared frontier of responsibility**, not conquest.

## Vision

From rebuilding Earth’s digital and ethical infrastructure →  
to extending human intelligence responsibly into space.

AIC-Aerospace exists to ensure that:
- Space exploration does not repeat Earth's mistakes
- Autonomous systems remain accountable to human values
- Intelligence scales **with restraint, foresight, and ethics**

## Core Principles

- **Ethics-first autonomy**
- **Human-in-the-loop by design**
- **Non-militarization of intelligence**
- **Transparency over performance hype**
- **Long-term civilization safety over short-term gains**

## What This Is (and Is Not)

**This is:**
- A research-oriented, ethical aerospace intelligence framework
- A sandbox for simulation, reasoning, and governance of AI in space

**This is NOT:**
- A weapon system
- A commercial launch platform
- A replacement for existing aerospace agencies

## Long-Term Goal

To contribute to a future where:
- Space systems are governed, not unleashed
- Intelligence expands civilization without erasing meaning
- Humanity remains responsible for what it creates beyond Earth

## Status

Early research & architecture phase  
Design-first, simulation-driven, ethics-bound
