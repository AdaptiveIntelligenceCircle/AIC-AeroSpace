# Threat Model – AIC-Aerospace

This document outlines adversarial and systemic threats.

---

## 1. External Threats

### A. Militarized Adoption
Actors repurpose navigation or propulsion models for weapon systems.

Mitigation:
- Architectural transparency
- Ethical disclaimers
- Community visibility

---

### B. Strategic Exploitation
Corporations or states exploit ISRU logic for aggressive extraction.

Mitigation:
- Sustainability constraints embedded in logic
- Public documentation of intended use

---

## 2. Internal Threats

### A. Optimization Capture
Engineering culture prioritizes performance over ethics.

Mitigation:
- Ethics-first review process
- Governance review before merge

### B. Complexity Explosion
System grows beyond explainability.

Mitigation:
- Modular boundaries
- Maximum complexity threshold per module

---

## 3. Emergent Threats

### A. Autonomous Goal Drift
System objectives subtly diverge over time.

Mitigation:
- Objective anchoring mechanism
- Periodic human re-authorization

### B. Authority Illusion
Humans assume system is safer than it is.

Mitigation:
- Explicit uncertainty reporting
- Confidence score exposure

---

## Threat Surface Summary

- Autonomy
- Adaptation
- Resource optimization
- Scale
- Dual-use potential

---

## Fundamental Principle

In space, there is no emergency exit.

Design accordingly.
