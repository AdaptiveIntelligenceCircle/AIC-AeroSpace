# Ethical Disclosure – AIC-Aerospace

Transparency precedes expansion.

This document discloses ethical boundaries and known limitations of AIC-Aerospace.

---

## 1. Dual-Use Risk

All aerospace intelligence research has inherent dual-use risk.

We explicitly reject:
- Military weaponization
- Strategic dominance applications
- Autonomous combat systems

---

## 2. Autonomy Boundaries

This project does NOT aim to:
- Remove humans from critical decision loops
- Create fully independent decision authority in space

Autonomy must remain supervised.

---

## 3. Resource Ethics

ISRU research does NOT imply:
- Unlimited extraction rights
- Ownership claims over celestial bodies

We align with:
- Long-term sustainability
- Shared stewardship principles

---

## 4. Environmental Impact

Space debris, orbital instability, and planetary contamination are considered ethical risks.

We do not support:
- Uncontrolled deployment of hardware
- Ecologically destructive experimentation

---

## 5. Unknown Unknowns

We acknowledge:
- We cannot foresee all consequences.
- Complexity grows faster than prediction.

Therefore:
- Scaling must remain slower than reflection.
- Ethics must lead engineering.

Participation in this project implies agreement with these disclosures.
